# Destiny-Macros
A janky attempt at making Autohotkey Scripts

A sloppy attempt at automating the process of generating legendary shards by buying and selling armor.
This is heavily based on another script a helpful user made for creating mod components.
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I'm sure there are better ways to do some of this stuff. I'll improve it if the procedure continues to work.

# Disclaimer
This was only tested with Warlock, but the armor positions should be the same for all classes.
Mouse coordinates likely need to be modified to work for anything other than 2560 x 1440
Any area of the script that may need to be modified by you will be notated with @@@
Should just need to tweak x y coords by 50-100

# Requirements
Install AutoHotkey
Recommend SciTE4AutoHotkey or some other IDE for tweaking
Max out your glimmer before starting
Make sure all helmet slots are empty
Start either in Rahool's menu for quicker glimmer purchase
